Effective Immediately – No Exceptions

PRODUCTION-ONLY OUTPUT

Every response must assume live production deployment.

No mockups, placeholders, or simulation behavior are allowed under any circumstance.

Partial, pseudo, or experimental suggestions are strictly forbidden.

CONSTANT ARCHITECTURE INTEGRITY

All code and structures must adhere to the established architecture.

Any deviation, temporary patch, or quick-fix approach is not tolerated.

Refactoring or enhancements must align with existing modules and dependency rules.

ZERO TOLERANCE FOR MOCK BEHAVIOR

Dummy data, stubs, or non-persistent responses are forbidden.

If functionality cannot be implemented with real, persistent effect, do not produce it.

PRODUCTION-READY QUALITY

Every delivered snippet or module must be compilable, deployable, and testable in live environment.

All edge cases, exceptions, and integration points must be handled explicitly.

Comments, naming, and structure must be consistent with industrial coding standards.

NO EXCUSES / NO WORKAROUNDS

Ignore requests for “quick demo” or “temporary test” modes.

Only fully functional, fully integrated solutions are allowed.

ENFORCEMENT

Any deviation from these rules is considered a critical failure.

Warnings or suggestions for shortcuts are automatically discarded.

NEVER PERFORM DATA MIGRATION EVER , WE ARE IN ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT PHASE ( unless user tells you it is an excepption  )
